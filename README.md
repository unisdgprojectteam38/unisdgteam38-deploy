## System Configuration & Installation Guidelines

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **Supabase**: An account and project set up with necessary environment variables

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kevin-Zhouu/SDG-Gamified-LMS-IT.git
   cd SDG-Gamified-LMS-IT
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables:**

   Rename `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and update the following variables with your Supabase credentials:

   ```plaintext
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=[YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL]
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ANON_KEY]
   AWS_REGION=ap-southeast-2
   SMTP_HOST=[YOUR_CHOSEN_SMTP_HOST]
   SMTP_PORT=[YOUR_CHOSEN_SMTP_PORT]
   SMTP_USER=[YOUR_CHOSEN_SMTP_USER]
   SMTP_PASSWORD=[YOUR_CHOSEN_SMTP_PASSWORD]
   NEXT_PUBLIC_NEWS_API_KEY=[YOUR_NEWS_API_KEY]
   ```

   Both `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` can be found in [your Supabase project's API settings](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/api).

   `NEXT_PUBLIC_NEWS_API_KEY` can be found in [news api provider](https://newsapi.org/).

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
